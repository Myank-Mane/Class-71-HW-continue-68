A humble boy, to the Director of one of the most reputed brands of Education in Mumbai, the journey of Yogesh Patel has been nothing but inspiring.

                                        It was almost two and a half decades ago, this ambitious young man who did not like the educational and admission system prevailing back then decided to start a school of his own. It was a journey which started in the 90’s and now his two most loved babies- SVISKandivali and SVIS Gorai went on to become one of the most sought after schools not only in Kandivali but all over Mumbai.

                                        Such is the aura of this humble man, that in a span of 24 years, thousands of students every year pass out from his school but still he manages to recognize instantly any of the kid who tries to contact him. Such is the charm of his persona, that when you are sitting with him, you will feel he is younger to you!

                                        Exactly 8 years after I passed out from SVIS, I sat with the same person I came to meet almost two decades ago with my parents for admission in Junior KG! Yogesh Patel who has a habit of staying connected with everyone and taking time out to meet ex-students and parents this time had a warm session of lunch mixed with interesting conversation at the MCA.
